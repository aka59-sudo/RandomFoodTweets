                                            PAST ISSUES
                                    
1. The first technical issue that I came across is finding out how to output the actual tweets from queries.
   I overcame this issue by going to the documentation to find the type of what is being returned. Once I found
   that out I looked for methods that would return what I was looking for.

2. The second technical issue that I came across occured when trying to output the respective URLs and actually have them 
   point to the right one. While using Flask and HTML, I overcame this issue by hardcoding the twitter URL into the "<a href>"
   tag while using Flask to fill in the last part.

                                            CURRENT ISSUES    
                                            
1. An issue that I still have is trying to have the CSS border the "<li>" tags the way I want it to. I've been looking
   into different documentation that might help me achieve what I'm looking for.

2. The second issue that I came across that I'm still trying to figure out is how to have the image of each user appear
   next to the accounts. I have some ideas about how I want to go about it but I have not been solid on the full details 
   #WorkInProgress

3. Another issue that I am currently having is deploying my app to Heroku. I am not sure what is going on but I am getting
   an error along the lines of a "default language can not be detected".
